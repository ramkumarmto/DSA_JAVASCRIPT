// why sorting algorithms are required ?

// it is neccessary that how fast user can search anything from anywhere 
// like google search engine
// any data is allready included ( like username)
// a lot of other example you could think.



// Implement linear search on arrays
// Implement binary search on sorted arrays
// Implement a naive string searching algorithm
// Implement the KMP string searching algorithm
